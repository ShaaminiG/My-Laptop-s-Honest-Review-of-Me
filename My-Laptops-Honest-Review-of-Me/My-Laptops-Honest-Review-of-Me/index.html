  <h1>My Laptop’s Honest Review of Me</h1>
  <p>Hello. I am a laptop. I have been used daily for studying, googling errors, opening too many tabs, and occasional
    emotional support. This is my honest review of the human who uses me.</p>

      <h2>Usage Patterns (How I’m Treated)</h2>
      <p>My owner uses me with enthusiasm but questionable discipline. While the intentions are good, the execution is
        chaotic.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keeps at least 150 tabs open at all times</li>
        <li>Eats snacks dangerously close to the keyboard</li>
        <li>Says “I’ll shut it down later” and never does</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Performance Expectations vs Reality</h2>
      <p>I am expected to load instantly, never crash, and survive long study sessions without rest. These expectations
        are unrealistic but consistently enforced.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open multiple heavy applications at once</li>
        <li>Expect silent operation under pressure</li>
        <li>Blame me for internet issues</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Strengths of the User (From My Perspective)</h2>
      <p>Despite everything, my user is committed and persistent. This makes the stress somewhat worth it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses me daily to learn new skills</li>
        <li>Doesn’t give up after errors</li>
        <li>Eventually closes tabs (sometimes)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Rating</h2>
      <p>Overall, my user means well. With better tab management and occasional breaks, this working relationship could
        improve significantly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Productivity: 7/10</li>
        <li>Organization: 4/10</li>
        <li>Effort: 9/10</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I love you. Please take care of me :)</p>
